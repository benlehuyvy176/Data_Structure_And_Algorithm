* Problem Statement
  /Given a set of 𝑛 segments {[𝑎0, 𝑏0], [𝑎1, 𝑏1], . . . , [𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑏𝑛−1]} with integer coordinates on a line, find the minimum number 𝑚 of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a set of integers 𝑋 of the minimum size such that for any segment [𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖] there is a point 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 such that 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏𝑖../
  - *Input:* The first line of the input contains the number 𝑛 of segments. Each of the following 𝑛 lines
contains two integers 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 (separated by a space) defining the coordinates of endpoints of the 𝑖-th
segment.
  - *Constraints:*  1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100; 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑏𝑖 ≤ 10**9 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛
  - *Output:* Output the minimum number 𝑚 of points on the first line and the integer coordinates of 𝑚 points (separated by spaces) on the second line

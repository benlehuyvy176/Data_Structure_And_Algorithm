* Problem Statement
  /The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise
distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as
𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + · · · + 𝑎𝑘 where 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑘 are positive integers and 𝑎𝑖 ̸= 𝑎𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘/

  - *Input:* The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.
  - *Constraints:*  1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10**9
  - *Output:* In the first line, output the maximum number 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be represented as a sum
of 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers. In the second line, output 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers
that sum up to 𝑛 (if there are many such representations, output any of them).
